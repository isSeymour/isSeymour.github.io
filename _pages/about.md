<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an undergraduate student in Information Security at the School of Computer Science and Technology, <a href='https://www.tongji.edu.cn'>Tongji University</a>. My research focuses on AI security, LLM, and graph representation learning. I previously worked with <a href='http://cs1.tongji.edu.cn/~dawei/'>Prof. Cheng</a>’s Financial Big Data Lab, where I took my first steps into research and contributed as a second author on a paper submitted to *TKDE* (a CCF-A journal), co-developing a fraud detection framework with generative graph representations.



# 🔥 News  
- *2025.05*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 Proposed a VAE-based IPv6 active address prediction framework, enabling efficient large-scale network scanning.  
- *2024.11*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 Developed an adversarial attack pipeline for facial recognition systems with masked momentum PGD, achieving controllable perturbation generation.
